# Define a function called `scrape` that will execute all of your scraping code from the `mission_to_mars.ipynb` notebook and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data. 

# It will be a good idea to create multiple smaller functions that are called by the `scrape()` function. 
# Remember, each function should have one 'job' (eg. you might have a `mars_news()` function that scrapes the NASA mars news site and returns the content as a list/tuple/dictionary/json)
# HINT: the headers in the notebook can serve as a useful guide to where one 'job' ends and another begins.
